DESCRIPTION
===========
Helps to achieve good localization.
The problem: We cannot achieve good localization because same translation codes are used on different
pages. For example, T('Edit') at discussions index and while editing role permissions in dashboard.

CONFIGURATION
=============
$Configuration['Plugins']['SmartLocalization']['DisableRolePermissionsTranslate'] = TRUE;
	This disables translation on add/edit role page, because rubbish translation is going out.

TODO
====
- ability to skip (keep original code) for desired pages

CHANGELOG
=========
2.6 (11 Dec 2011)
- removed support for deprecated names
- allow disable translation on add/edit role page

2.5 (13 Jun 2011)
- own caching system
- changelog started
