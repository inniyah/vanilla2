# File Upload Detect #

### About ###
 This a fork of [FileUpload](http://vanillaforums.org/addon/fileupload-plugin) 
 by Tim Gunter and released under the same GPL licence.
 
 At the moment this links [Open Icon Library](http://openiconlibrary.sourceforge.net/) 
 "Oxygen" icons to uploads, with a file mapping.  So it will display the attachments 
 with the relevant graphic based on file extension. 
 
 ### Important ###
 It is a good idea not only to disable other file upload plugins, but also move their folder, into another folder 
 This will reduce the chance of conflicts by removing those from the plugins folder.

### Sponsor ###
Special thanks to mikizzi for making this happen.
